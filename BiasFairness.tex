\section{Bias and Fairness}
\begin{comment}
	Labeling is biased, if you predict the same labels, we only reproduce the bias.\\
	The sample selection is also biased, as sometimes the training data only fits a certain profile (crime).\\
	Sometimes the whole task is biased, anyone who does not fall in a certain category is not included from the beginning.\\
	If the test set is imbalanced, the loss function learns to ignore the minorities, to get the majority right.\\

\textbf{Consequentialism:} Make choice with best consequence\\

\textbf{Utilitarism:} Hedonistic, preference satisfaction, welfare\\
\begin{comment}
	Utilitarism is a specific case of consequentialism.
	Hedonistic: Individual pleasure\\
	Preference satisfaction: Inderect Pleasure\\
	Welfare: Long-term over short term satisfaction\\
\end{comment}

\textbf{Deontiology:} Rules must be kept, no matter what.\\
\begin{comment}
	Break rules even when there are good reasons to do it is wrong.
	Be good is not the same as not being bad.\\
\end{comment}

\textbf{Social Contract:} Assumes natural equality of all\\
\begin{comment}
	Obligations between agents are conventional; conventions secure important human interests.\\
	Mutually advantageous: Nothing wrong with harming people, but better not to if that means others can harm me.\\
	Morality as a right: We all have equal innate rights (rights to fair trial, etc.) which are not negotiated
\end{comment}

\textbf{Anti-subordination:} Pos. discrimination needed for equality\\
\begin{comment}
	You discriminate by actively searching for a women, but only to address that there are not enough women.\\
