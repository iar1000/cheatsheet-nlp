\section{Introduction}
\textbf{Grammaticality:} Conformity to the rules of a grammar. A string of words is being judged to be grammatical or not. Determine $A\subset\Sigma^*$, whereas $\Sigma^*$ a finite set of words, which is considered grammatically correct by a native speaker.\\
\begin{comment}Grammatically correct has a lot to do with language intuition, since humans do not have the ability to perfectly speak a language. Native speakers have an intuition about what is correct or not.
\end{comment}\\ 
\textbf{Competence:} Platonic ideal of a true grammar of the language. People are imperfect and unable. \\
\textbf{Performance:} Realizable; How humans produce and process language. \\
\begin{comment}
	Syntacticians develop functions that take a string of words and outputs if it is grammatically correct or not. They care about complexity, finding the least complex formalism, in the Chompsky hierarchy, to achieve this function.
\end{comment}
% TODO Does lest complex mean lower type in the hierarchy?
\textbf{Linguistics:} Study of phonology (sound abstraction), morphology (word building), syntax (word order), semantics (meaning). Mostly theory about structure of language.\\
\textbf{NLP:} Making NL accesible to computers. Hard, because meaning is expressed in different ways, context dependent and differ across languages, dialects, regions.\\
